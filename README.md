NBSVM is a novel baseline model for text classification problem which outperforms both NB (Naive Bayes) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) in datasets with different sizes/features. 
This idea is originated from <Baselines and Bigrams Simple, Good Sentiment and Topic Classification> and the author offered the code in Matlab. Here is the implementation in Python code.
